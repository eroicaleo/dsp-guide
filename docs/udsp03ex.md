# Chapter 03 The Discrete Fourier Transform

## 3.1

Let’s assume that we have performed a 20-point DFT on a sequence 
of real-valued time-domain samples, and we want to send our $X(m)$ 
DFT results to a  colleague using e-mail. What is the absolute 
minimum number of (complex) frequency-domain sample values we will 
need to type in our e-mail so that our colleague has complete 
information regarding our DFT results?

**Solution**:

Since it is symmetric, we will just need send 10.

$\square$

## 3.2

Assume a systems engineer directs you to start designing a system 
that performs spectrum analysis using DFTs. The systems engineer 
states that the spectrum analysis system’s input data sample rate, 
$f_s$, is $1000$ Hz and specifies that the DFT’s frequency-domain sample spacing must be exactly $45$ Hz.

(a) What is the number of necessary input time samples, $N$, for a 
single DFT operation?

**Solution**:

If we want to achieve $45$ Hz, we know the DFT’s frequency spacing 
(resolution) is $f_s/N$.

So $f_s / N \leq 45$, then $N \geq 23$.

$\square$

(b) What do you tell the systems engineer regarding the spectrum 
analysis system’s specifications?

**Solution**:

The $f_s$ needs to be $900$ Hz.

$\square$

## 3.3

We want to compute an $N$-point DFT of a one-second-duration 
compact disc (CD) audio signal $x(n)$, whose sample rate is
$fs = 44.1$ kHz, with a DFT sample spacing of $1$ Hz.

(a) What is the number of necessary $x(n)$ time samples, $N$?

**Solution**: Again, we know the DFT’s frequency spacing 
(resolution) is $f_s/N$. So

$$ 
\frac{f_s}{N} = \frac{44100}{N} = 1
$$

Then $N = 441000$.

$\square$

(b) What is the time duration of the $x(n)$ sequence measured in 
seconds?
Hint: This Part (b) of the problem is trickier than it first 
appears. Think carefully.

**Solution**:

It should be

$$ 
1 \text{ second} \cdot \frac{44100 - 1}{44100} \approx 0.99997732
\text{ second}
$$

$\square$

## 3.4

Assume we have a discrete $x(n)$ time-domain sequence of samples 
obtained from lowpass sampling of an analog signal, $x(t)$.
If $x(n)$ contains $N = 500$ samples, and it was obtained at a 
sample rate of $f_s = 3000$ Hz:

(a) What is the frequency spacing of $x(n)$’s DFT samples, $X(m)$, 
measured in Hz?

**Solution**:

Again, it is

$$ 
\frac{f_s}{N} = \frac{3000}{500} = 6 \text{ Hz}
$$

$\square$

(b) What is the highest-frequency spectral component that can be 
present in the analog $x(t)$ signal where no aliasing errors occur 
in $x(n)$?

**Solution**:

The highest-frequency spectral component has to be $\leq \frac{f_s}
{2}$.

$\square$

(c) If you drew the full $X(m)$ spectrum and several of its 
spectral replications, what is the spacing between the spectral 
replications measured in Hz?

**Solution**:

I am not exactly sure. Let's say the original signal has the
frequency component of $1500 - 6 = 1494$ Hz. Then the spacing
between spectral replications is $(1500 + 6) - (1500-6) = 12$ Hz.

$\square$

## 3.5

What are the magnitudes of the 8-point DFT samples of

(a) the $x_1(n) = 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9$ sequence (explain how 
you arrived at your solution)?

**Solution**: We cannot apply the formula (3-17) because the
input does not contain a sine wave.

$$ 
M_r = \frac{A_o N}{2}
$$

So we have to directly use the FFT equation

$$ 
X(m) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2πnm/N} \\
= 9 \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} e^{-j2πnm/N} \\
=
\begin{cases}
    72 &\text{if } m = 0 \\
    0 &\text{if } m \neq 0 \\
\end{cases} 
$$

$\square$

(b) the $x_2(n) = 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0$ sequence (explain how 
you arrived at your solution)?

**Solution**:

$$ 
X(m) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2πnm/N} \\
= x(0) = 1
$$

$\square$

(c) the $x_3(n) = 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0$ sequence (explain how 
you arrived at your solution)?

Because the $x_3(n)$ sequence in Part (c) is merely a time-shifted 
version of the $x_2(n)$ sequence in Part (b), comment on the 
relationship of the $|X_2(m)|$ and $|X_3(m)|$ DFT samples.

**Solution**:

Note $x_3(n) = x_2(n-1)$, so

$$ 
X_3(m) = e^{-j2πm/8} X_2(m)
$$

Then

$$ 
|X_3(m)| = |e^{-j2πm/8} X_2(m)| \\
= |X_2(m)| = 1
$$

$\square$

## 3.6

Consider sampling exactly three cycles of a continuous $x(t)$ 
sinusoid resulting
in an 8-point $x(n)$ time sequence whose 8-point DFT is the
$X(m)$ shown in Figure P3–6. If the sample rate used to obtain
$x(n)$ was 4000 Hz, write the time-domain equation for the 
discrete $x(n)$ sinusoid in trigonometric 
form. Show how you arrived at your answer.

![](./assets/ex0306.png)

**Solution**:

We can simply do a IDFT.
Note that $A = 8, X(3) = A e^{j(π/4)}, X(5) = A e^{-j(π/4)}$ 

$$
\begin{split}
x(n) &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X(m) e^{j2πmn/N} \\
&= \frac{A}{8}
(e^{j(π/4 + 6πn/8)} + e^{-j(π/4 + 6πn/8)}) \\
&= \frac{A}{4}
\cos (\frac{3n+1}{4} \pi) \\
&= 2 \cos (\frac{3n+1}{4} \pi)
\end{split}
$$

The python code

```python
N = 8
n = np.arange(0, 8, 1)
A = 8
x = (A/4) * np.cos ((3*n+1)/4 * np.pi)
np.around(x, 4)

array([ 1.4142, -2.    ,  1.4142,  0.    , -1.4142,  2.    , -1.4142, -0.    ])

X = fft(x)
np.around(X, 4)

array([-0.    -0.j    , -0.    -0.j    , -0.    -0.j    ,  5.6569+5.6569j,
        0.    -0.j    ,  5.6569-5.6569j, -0.    +0.j    , -0.    +0.j    ])
```

$\square$

## 3.7

In the text’s Section 3.1 we discussed the computations necessary 
to compute the $X(0)$ sample of an $N$-point DFT. That $X(0)$ 
output sample represents the zero Hz (DC) spectral component of an 
$x(n)$ input sequence. Because it is the DC component, $X(0)$ is 
real-only and we’re free to say that an $X(0)$ sample always has 
zero phase. With that said, here are two interesting DFT problems:

(a) Given that an $N$-point DFT’s input sequence $x(n)$ is 
real-only, and $N$ is an even number, is there any value for $m$ 
(other than $m = 0$) for which an $X(m)$ DFT output sample is 
always real-only?

**Solution**

$$ 
X(m) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2πnm/N} 
$$

If $N$ is an even number and $m = N / 2$, then

$$ 
e^{-j2πnm/N} = e^{-jπn} = \cos (πn) + i \sin (πn) = \pm 1
$$

Then $X(N/2)$ is real-only.

$\square$

(b) Given that $N$ is an odd number, is there any value for $m$ 
(other than $m = 0$) where an $X(m)$ DFT output sample is always 
real-only?

**Solution**:

From section 3.2, if that real input function is even, then $X(m)$ 
is always real and even.

$\square$

## 3.8

Using the following rectangular form for the DFT equation:

$$ 
X(m) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) [\cos (2πnm/N) - j \sin(2πnm/N)] 
$$

$N$ is an even number, frequency $f_s$ is the $x(n)$ sequence’s sample 
rate in Hz, time index $n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N–1$, and $θ$ is an initial 
phase angle measured in radians.
Hint: Recall the trigonometric identity

$$
\sin(α+β) = \sin(α)\cos(β) + \cos(α)\sin(β)
$$.

(a) Prove that the $f_s/2$ spectral sample is $X(N/2) = N · \sin(θ)$ 
when the $x(n)$ input is a sinusoidal sequence defined by

$$ 
x(n) = \sin[2π(f_s/2)nt_s + θ].
$$

**Proof**:

First note that the original analog waveform frequency should be
$f_s / 2$.

Then note, when $m = N/2$, then

$$ 
\cos (2πnm/N) = \cos (n \pi) = \pm 1\\
\sin (2πnm/N) = \sin (n \pi) = 0 \\
$$

Then

$$
\begin{split}
X(N/2) &= x(0) - x(1) + \cdots + x(N-2) - x(N-1) \\
&= \sin (0π + θ) - \sin (1π + θ) + \cdots + \sin ((N-2)π + θ) -
\sin ((N-1)π + θ) \\
&= N \sin (θ)    
\end{split}
$$

Note that this is also intuitively correct, when $θ = 0$, and
we sample at $f_s$ for a $f_s/2$ sine wave, we can only get 0.

$\square$

(b) What is $X(N/2)$ when $x(n) = \sin[2π(f_s/2)nt_s]$?

**Solution**: As mentioned in the end of part (a), it's 0.

$\square$

(c) What is $X(N/2)$ when $x(n) = \cos[2π(f_s/2)nt_s]$?

**Solution**:

Note $\cos t = \sin (t + π/2)$, so $θ = π/2$.

$$ 
X(N/2) = N \sin (θ) = N
$$

$\square$

## 3.9

To gain some practice in using the algebra of discrete signals and the 
geometric series identities in Appendix B, and to reinforce our 
understanding of the output magnitude properties of a DFT when its 
input is an exact integer number of sinusoidal cycles:

(a) Prove that when a DFT’s input is a complex sinusoid of magnitude
$A_o$ (i.e. $x(n) = e^{j2πfn t_s}$) with exactly three cycles over $N$ 
samples the output magnitude of the DFT’s
$m = 3$ bin will be $|X(3)| = A_o N$.

Hint: The first step is to redefine $x(n)$’s $f$ and $t_s$ variables in 
terms of a sample rate $f_s$ and $N$ so that $x(n)$ has exactly three 
cycles over $N$ samples. The redefined $x(n)$ is then applied to the 
standard DFT equation.

**Proof**:

Note that $N t_s f = 3$, so $f t_s = \frac{3}{N}$. Then

$$ 
e^{j2πfn t_s} = e^{j2π n 3 / N}
$$

Then

$$
\begin{split}
X(m) &= A_o \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2πnm/N} \\
&= A_o \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} e^{j2π n 3 / N} e^{-j2πnm/N} \\
&= A_o \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} e^{j2π (3-m) n / N} \\
\end{split}
$$

So when $m = 3$,

$$ 
X(3) = A_o \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} e^{j2π 0 n / N}
= A_o N
$$

$\square$

(b) Prove that when a DFT’s input is a real-only sinewave of peak 
amplitude $A_o$ (i.e., $x(n) = A_o \sin(2πfnt_s)$) with exactly three cycles over $N$ samples, the
output magnitude of the DFT’s $m=3$ bin will be $|X(3)|= A_o N/2$.

Hint: Once you redefine $x(n)$’s $f$ and $t_s$ variables in terms of a 
sample rate $f_s$ and $N$ so that $x(n)$ has exactly three cycles over 
$N$ samples, you must convert that real sinewave to complex exponential 
form so that you can evaluate its DFT for $m = 3$.

**Solution**:

Note

$$
\begin{split}
x(n) &= A_o \sin(2πfnt_s) \\
&= A_o \frac{e^{j2πfn t_s} - e^{-j2πfn t_s}}{2j} \\
&= A_o \frac{e^{j2πn 3 / N} - e^{-j2πn 3 / N}}{2j} \\
\end{split}
$$

So

$$ 
\begin{split}
X(3) &= \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2πn3/N} \\
&= \frac{A_o}{2j} \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} (e^{j2πn 0 / N} - e^{-j12πn / N}) \\
&= \frac{A_o}{2j} \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} (1 - e^{-j12πn / N})
\end{split}
$$

Now use results in Appendix B

$$ 
\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} e^{-j12πn / N} =
\frac{1 - e^{-j12π}}{1 - e^{-j12π / N}} \\
= 0
$$

So $X(3) = \frac{N A_o}{2j}$, so $|X(3)| = \frac{A_o N}{2}$.

$\square$

## 3.10

Consider performing the 5-point DFT on the following $x_1(n)$ 
time-domain samples

$$ 
x_1(n) = [1, 2.2, –4, 17, 21],
$$

and the DFT’s first sample is $X_1(0) = 37.2$. Next, consider 
performing the 5-point DFT on the following $x_2(n)$ time samples

$$ 
x_2(n) = [1, 2.2, –4, 17, Q],
$$

and that DFT’s first sample is $X_2(0) = 57.2$. What is the value 
of $Q$ in the $x_2(n)$ time sequence? Justify your answer.

**Solution**:

$$ 
X(m) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2πnm/N} 
$$

So

$$ 
X(0) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n)
$$

So $Q = 57.2 - (1 + 2.2 -4 +17) = 41$.

$\square$

## 3.11

Derive the equation describing $X(m)$, the $N$-point DFT of the following $x(n)$ sequence:

$$ 
x(n) = a^n, \qquad \text{for} 0 \leq n \leq N-1.
$$

Hint: Recall one of the laws of exponents, $p^bq^{bc} = (pq^c)^b$, and the geometric series identities in Appendix B.

**Solution**:

$$
\begin{split}
X(m) &= \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2πnm/N} \\
&= \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} a^n e^{-j2πnm/N} \\
&= \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} (a e^{-j2πm/N})^n \\
&= \frac{1 - a^N e^{-j2πm}}{1 - a e^{-j2πm/N}}
\end{split}
$$

$\square$

## 3.12

Consider an N-sample $x(n)$ time sequence whose DFT is represented by $X(m)$,
where $0 \leq m \leq N–1$. Given this situation, an Internet website once stated,
“The sum of the $X(m)$ samples is equal to $N$ times the first $x(n)$ sample.” Being
suspicious of anything we read on the Internet, show whether or not that
statement is true.

Hint: Use the inverse DFT process to determine the appropriate $x(n)$ time
sample of interest in terms of $X(m)$.

**Solution**:

The IDFT shows

$$ 
x(n) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X(m) e^{j2πmn/N} 
$$

Plug $n = 0$ into it

$$ 
x(0) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X(m) e^{j2πm0/N} \\
= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X(m) \\
\Rightarrow \\
\sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X(m) = N x(0) \\
$$

$\square$

## 3.13

Here is a problem whose solution may be useful to you in the future. On the
Internet you will find information suggesting that an inverse DFT can be
computed using a forward DFT software routine in the process shown in Figure P3–13.

![](./assets/ex0313.png)

(a) Using the forward and inverse DFT equations, and the material in Appendix A,
show why the process in Figure P3–13 computes correct inverse DFTs.

Hint: Begin your solution by writing the inverse DFT equation and conjugating
both sides of that equation.

**Solution**:

$$ 
x(n) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X(m) e^{j2πmn/N} \\
$$

Note that

$$
\begin{split}
\left( X(m) e^{j2πmn/N} \right)^* 
&= X^*(m) e^{-j2πmn/N} \\
&= (X_{\text{real}}(m) - X_{\text{imag}}(m)) e^{-j2πmn/N} \\
\end{split}
$$

We have to assume $X(m)$ is symmetric. If so
Then

$$ 
\sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X_{\text{real}}(m) e^{-j2πmn/N}
\quad
\text{is real} \\
\sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X_{\text{imag}}(m) e^{-j2πmn/N}
\quad
\text{is pure imaginary} \\
$$

So

$$ 
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X_{\text{real}}(m) e^{-j2πmn/N}
= x_{\text{real}}(n) \\
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{m = 0}^{N-1} X_{\text{imag}}(m) e^{-j2πmn/N}
= x_{\text{imag}}(n) \\
$$

$\square$

(b) Comment on how the process in Figure P3–13 changes if the 
original frequency-domain $X(m)$ sequence is conjugate symmetric.

**Solution**:

Then there will be no $x_{\text{imag}}(n)$, only
$x_{\text{real}}(n)$ left.

$\square$
