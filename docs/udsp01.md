# Chapter 01 Discrete Sequences and Systems

## 1.1 DISCRETE SEQUENCES AND THEIR NOTATION

* Think of a continuous sinewave with a
peak amplitude of $1$ at a frequency $f_o$ 
described by the equation

$$ 
\tag{1-1}
x(t) = \sin 2 \pi f_o t
$$

* Those sample values can be represented 
  collectively, and concisely, by the 
  discrete-time expression

$$ 
\tag{1-3}
x(n) = \sin 2 \pi f_o n t_s
$$
